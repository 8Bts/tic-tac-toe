# Object Oriented Programming - Tic Tac Toe console game

This project is about exercising the main concepts of object-oriented programming particularly classes and access to their attributes to build a tic tac toe game that runs in the terminal.

<h3>About the Game</h3>
<p>Tic Tac Toe is a game played between two players. It is played on a 3x3 grid board and can be played for as many times as desired. 
Players take turns to mark the grid and their selections are reflected on the grid with X and O characters. The winner of the game is determined when one of the players makes a complete row or column or diagonal of the grid. </p>

<h3>How to play</h3>
On each turn, players must select a cell number displayed on the board which is going to be marked with players' special sign. To make a selection player must enter the number that represents a cell. This number has to be in the 1 to 9 range. You cannot sign a cell that is already signed. In order to win a game, the player has to sign 3 cells that follow each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Here are some winning cases:

<h3>Project Description</h3>
In this project, we created actual logic for the tic-tac-toe game. We defined _Player_, _GameBoard_ classes, and _GamePlay_ module in the separate .rb files. Here are the purposes of these assets:

- **Player**
 This class represents player information like _name_, played turns, and _sign_ used to mark gameboard. It also defines 2 methods that are responsible for _make_turn_ and _reset_ the turns state.

- **GameBoard**
This class is responsible for rendering the game board, modifying and resetting it. It has 1 class variable _@@board_cells_ which is used for storing(and modifying!) the values of board cells, and it has 5 class methods to _print_board_, _mark_board_, _clear_board_, _update_board_ and _reset_board_.

- **GamePlay**
We created this module to determine the winner of the game. It has a constant WIN_STATES which is for storing the cell combinations that make the player wins. There is also a _won?_ a function that accepts parameter _Player_ object and compares the _@turns_ variable of the player with the WIN_STATES constant. The result of this comparison going to be the result of this method. We added a custom method to _Array_ class called _contain_all?_ which is used inside _won?_ method.

- **Executable File**
In the main.rb file we defined some methods to optimize code and avoid repeated code. This is the executable file for the game.
